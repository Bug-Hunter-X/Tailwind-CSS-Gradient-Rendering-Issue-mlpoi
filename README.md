# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential bug with Tailwind CSS gradients and provides a solution.  The issue involves inconsistencies in how gradients render across different browsers, particularly concerning the direction specified in the gradient definition.

## Bug Description:
The `bg-gradient-to-r` utility in Tailwind CSS may not render correctly in all browsers, leading to unexpected visual results or the gradient not appearing at all.

## Solution:
The solution involves providing fallback styles to ensure the gradient is displayed correctly even if the specified direction isn't supported or other rendering issues arise.
