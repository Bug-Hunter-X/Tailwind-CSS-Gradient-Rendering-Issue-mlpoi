```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 bg-blue-500">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This solution adds a fallback background color (`bg-blue-500` in this case).  If the gradient fails to render for any reason, the fallback ensures a consistent visual experience. You could also use a different fallback gradient or a solid color that best suits your design.
