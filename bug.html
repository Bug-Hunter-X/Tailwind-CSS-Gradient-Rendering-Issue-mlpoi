```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS's gradient feature. However, if the browser doesn't support the `to-r` direction or other issues, it might not render correctly.  The gradient might not appear, or might show unexpected results.
